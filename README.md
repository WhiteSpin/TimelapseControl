# TimelapseControl
Arduino camera control designed for timelapse-photography with usb-host-shield + lcd-keypad-shield + motor for sliding

**Ive decided to split this project in two, one for [timelapse control with arduino](https://github.com/boeckhoff/ArduinoTimelapse) and one that deals only with the slider part, therefore this repository is discontinued.**

- Arduino UNO
	
- Keyes USB Host Shield

- Sain Smart LCD-Keypad Shield v1.0
	
- L298N Dual H Bridge
	
- Slider that I ripped out of a printer
	

######Software:
